This expression reduces n by the smallest-nonzero bit in its base 2 representation. This is because subtracting 1 from a base 2 number is the same as setting the lowest-valued "1" to "0" and setting all lower place values to "1". 

So, for instance, it reduces 18 to 16, because the binary representation of 18 is 10010 and removing the lowest non-zero bit of this gives 10000, which is 16. 

Therefore, in order to count the number of one-bits in an integer, we can simply count the number of times this expression needs to be applied to an integer until it reaches 0.
